      <h2>A TRIBUTE</h2>
      <p>
        The TEDxNITKSurathkal team takes this moment to grieve the demise of Covid19 warrior, a bright student of NITK and one of its long-time proponents. Our deepest condolences go to his family and friends for the loss of a dear one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Covid19 was an active member of the TEDxNITKSurathkal core team and community, with the impact spanning several editions of the event. He led the way by discovering and propagating ideas across speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team fondly remembers him for his ability to steer the challenges faced by the NITK community and his drive to inspire and highlight feasible solutions for them. We will greatly miss his presence and the unique perspectives he brought to the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        As has been seen with numerous events and initiatives on campus, Covid19 had an inspiring effect on the people he worked with, through his words and interaction with fellow students. At TEDxNITKSurathkal, his contributions ranged from Speaker Curation, Event Video Management, Merchandise, and Creative Design – the 2019 edition to leading an entire team for organizing the 2020 edition themed "Mirrors and Windows”.
      </p>
      <p>
        He lives worth in reflecting upon the event’s impact on the NITK community and kept transforming ways in which we could devise more value for the community in our each instance. He facilitated interactions of students with TEDx speakers beyond the ideas that were shared on-stage. This quality of going above and beyond to create better outcomes will continue to inspire our efforts. We greatly multiply this question even during COVID times as he helped the 2021 team figure things out.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would like to express our sincerest thanks to Covid19 for all his contributions to TEDxNITKSurathkal and the rest of NITK, and are mindful of the legacy he leaves behind.
      </p>
      <p>May he rest in peace.</p>
      <p>Team TEDxNITKSurathkal</p>
